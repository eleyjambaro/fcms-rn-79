# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

FCMS (Food Cost Management System) is a React Native POS/inventory management app for food service businesses. It supports offline-first operation via local SQLite, cloud sync, multi-company/multi-branch setups, and thermal receipt printing.

## Architecture

### Authentication System

**Cloud Auth is the primary and only supported auth mode.** Local Auth (`AuthStack`) is legacy and deprecated — do not build new features against it.

- **Cloud Auth** (`CloudAuthStackV2`): Email/password or OTP sign-in → device registration → branch selection. Tokens stored in `react-native-fast-secure-storage` under keys in `/src/constants/rnSecureStorageKeys.js`. State managed by `CloudAuthContextProvider`.
  - Sub-accounts (team members) sign in via `CloudV2SubAccountSignIn` and require a `device_id` tied to their account via `DeviceAccountAssignment` on the server.
  - `App.js` gates on `isCloudAuthenticated && hasDevice && hasBranch` — all three must be true to show `RootStack`.
- **Local Auth** (`AuthStack`): **Deprecated.** Do not add new features here.

### Multi-Company / Multi-Branch Data Isolation

**Each company+branch pair gets its own SQLite database file.** This is enforced at the `getDBConnection()` level in `/src/localDb/index.js` — no query-level filtering is needed or used.

- DB filename: `FCMS_<companyId>_<branchId>` when both are known (normal operating state). Falls back to `FCMS_<companyId>` when only the company is known (e.g. during device registration before a branch is assigned), and to `FCMS.db` in the unauthenticated state where no company data is accessed.
- `setActiveCompanyDb(companyId, branchId)` in `/src/localDb/index.js` sets the active company and branch, creates tables (`createTables()`), runs migrations (`alterTables()`), and creates SQL views (`createViews()`). It is **async** and must be `await`ed. When both IDs are provided it also runs `migrateCompanyDbToBranchScopedDb` — a one-time file rename that promotes any legacy `FCMS_<companyId>` file to `FCMS_<companyId>_<branchId>` so existing users keep their data after the branch-scoped naming change.
- `getActiveCompanyId()` and `getActiveBranchId()` return the currently active IDs — used by company+branch-scoped AsyncStorage keys (e.g. units).
- `CloudAuthContextProvider` calls `setActiveCompanyDb` at every auth transition (restore, sign-in, sign-up, OTP verify, **and branch selection**) **before** dispatching state, so `isLoading` stays `true` until the DB is ready. It also seeds defaults (`setDefaultUnits`, `createDefaultSettings`) at the same point.
- On sign-out or user switch, `queryClient.clear()` is called to purge React Query's cache so no prior user's data is visible to the next user.

### Dual Database System

- **Company DB** (`FCMS_<companyId>_<branchId>`): Items, recipes, purchases, expenses, revenues, settings, units, etc. Queried via `/src/localDbQueries/`. **Company+branch-scoped — one file per company/branch combination.**
- **Account DB** (`FCMSLocalAccount.db`): Legacy local auth data (accounts, roles, companies). Used only by the deprecated local auth system. Do not add new tables here.
- Direct SQL queries use a promise-based wrapper in `/src/localDb/`.
- Query builders in `/src/utils/localDbHelpers.js` support `%IN`, `%LIKE` filter operators and `createQueryFilter()`.

#### Company+branch-scoped AsyncStorage

Units are stored in AsyncStorage under a company+branch-scoped key (`units_<companyId>_<branchId>`), managed by `/src/localData/units.js`. `getActiveCompanyId()` and `getActiveBranchId()` are used to derive the key. Never use a bare hardcoded key for per-company or per-branch data.

### Delta Sync (Cloud Sync)

All Company DB tables participate in delta sync **except**: `app_versions`, `operations`, `saved_printers`, `settings`, and `sync_metadata`. Account DB tables are never synced.

Delta sync tables receive four extra columns added via `alterTables()` in `/src/localDb/index.js`:

- `sync_id` — UUID assigned on insert, used as the cloud record key
- `updated_at` — set to `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` on every insert/update/soft-delete
- `synced_at` — stamped by the sync service after a successful push
- `is_deleted` — soft-delete flag (`1` = deleted); **never use `DELETE FROM` on these tables**

**Soft-delete rule**: all deletions on delta sync tables must use `UPDATE … SET is_deleted = 1, updated_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` instead of `DELETE FROM`. Hard deletes are only allowed on excluded tables (`app_versions`, `operations`, `saved_printers`, `settings`, `monthly_expenses`, and Account DB tables).

**Active views**: `createViews()` in `/src/localDb/index.js` creates an `active_<table>` SQLite view for every delta sync table (e.g. `active_items`, `active_inventory_logs`). Each view is defined as `SELECT * FROM <table> WHERE IFNULL(is_deleted, 0) != 1` — **the `IFNULL` is required** because pulled records can have `is_deleted = NULL` and `NULL != 1` evaluates to NULL (falsy) in SQLite, which would silently hide every such row. **All SELECT queries in `/src/localDbQueries/` must use these views instead of the base tables** so soft-deleted records are automatically excluded. Use an alias matching the original table name to keep column references working:

```sql
FROM active_items items
JOIN active_inventory_logs inventory_logs ON inventory_logs.item_id = items.id
```

INSERT / UPDATE / DELETE continue to target the base tables directly. To change what "active" means globally, update only `createViews()`.

Delta sync tables (defined in `DELTA_SYNC_TABLES` constant in `/src/localDb/index.js`):

#### Sync Invariants (read before touching sync code)

These rules exist because each was learned the hard way — every violation in the past caused silent data loss (rows pulled but invisible, columns dropped, entities never returned). Treat them as load-bearing.

1. **Schema parity, server ↔ client.** Every column listed in a server-side `GROUP_A` entry's `allowedFields` (`fcms-api/src/app/Http/Controllers/SyncController.php`) must exist as a column in the matching client table (created in `createTables()` or added by an `alterTables` migration in `/src/localDb/index.js`). Adding a server column without the matching client `ALTER TABLE … ADD COLUMN …` causes `applyPulledRecord` to drop it; in dev that throws (see rule 6), in prod it just logs and drops.

2. **Entity parity.** Every entity in the server's `SyncController::GROUP_A` must appear in the client's `GROUP_A_ENTITIES` (`/src/services/syncService.js`) with the correct `pushFieldMap`. An entity present on one side and missing on the other is silently never synced.

3. **Soft-delete views are NULL-safe.** Always `WHERE IFNULL(is_deleted, 0) != 1`. Never bare `is_deleted != 1` — `NULL != 1` is NULL/falsy in SQLite and hides the row. `createViews()` is the single source; if you write any other view that filters soft-deletes, use the same pattern.

4. **Soft-delete writes set `updated_at`.** Every delete on a delta-sync table is `UPDATE … SET is_deleted = 1, updated_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`. Hard `DELETE FROM` is allowed only on excluded tables (see top of this section). A soft-delete without `updated_at` won't sync to other devices because push collects only rows where `updated_at > synced_at`.

5. **Pull queries tolerate NULL `updated_at`.** Server-side pull uses `COALESCE(updated_at, created_at, '1970-01-01 00:00:00') > ?` (not bare `updated_at > ?`). Legacy rows or rows from a client that forgot to set `updated_at` would otherwise be excluded from every pull, forever.

6. **Never use `INSERT OR IGNORE` in sync.** Use an explicit existence check then plain `INSERT`. `INSERT OR IGNORE` swallows NOT NULL, FK, and duplicate-column errors silently — which is exactly how "items pulled but invisible" stayed a mystery for so long. `applyPulledRecord` filters the payload against `PRAGMA table_info` so a stale schema produces a loud `__DEV__` throw, not a silent drop.

7. **FKs are OFF during sync.** `runSync()` issues `PRAGMA foreign_keys=OFF` before inserting because entities arrive out of dependency order (e.g. an `ingredients` row can land before its parent `recipes` row). The UUID migration turns FKs on at the end, so this PRAGMA is required on each sync.

8. **`runSync()` requires the active company DB.** It bails if `getActiveBranchId()` does not match the branch read from secure storage — otherwise the foreground sync started by `useAppLifecycle` can land on the unauth `FCMS.db` fallback before `CloudAuthContextProvider.restore()` has called `setActiveCompanyDb`.

9. **Branch switches await the first pull.** `setDesignatedBranch()` calls `runSync()` synchronously and only dispatches `SET_DESIGNATED_BRANCH` once the initial pull lands. `App.js` holds on `Splash` while `isSwitchingBranch` is true. Fire-and-forget syncs (`scheduleSyncSoon`) are fine for incremental updates but never for the first pull after a branch change — the user would see the empty new-branch DB.

10. **`device_id` is preserved in echo suppression, except on initial pull.** When `since === '1970-01-01T00:00:00Z'` (sync_metadata empty) the client omits the `X-Device-Id` header so the server does NOT filter out the requesting device's own historical rows. Without this, reinstalls and branch switches with locally-originated rows would pull nothing.

11. **Migrations are idempotent and run on every `setActiveCompanyDb`.** `createTables`, `alterTables`, and `createViews` all use `IF NOT EXISTS` (or `DROP + CREATE` for views, so view definitions update on existing DBs). Never write a non-idempotent migration here — it runs on every sign-in, restore, and branch switch.

### Batch Transfer (Branch-to-Branch)

Branch-to-branch batch transfer is a **non-VAT** operation — the receiving branch records stock at the source branch's cost basis, not at a freshly invoiced price.

When snapshotting an item's unit cost onto `batch_transfer_entries.unit_cost_snapshot` (in `/src/localDbQueries/batchTransfer.js`), use `item.avg_unit_cost_net` from `getItems` — the VAT-stripped moving weighted average from inventory logs. Do NOT use the static `item.unit_cost` (gross/VAT-inclusive) and do NOT use `item.avg_unit_cost` (also gross).

Why net, not gross: transfer itself does not add VAT. If the snapshot were gross/VAT-inclusive, VAT would be double-counted downstream when the destination later sells with VAT. This matches the existing `remove_stock` convention in `inventoryLogs.js` where `unitCost = avg_unit_cost_net` and `unitCostTax = 0`.

Why avg, not the static `unit_cost`: `unit_cost` is the configured/initial price and can be stale relative to actual purchase history. `avg_unit_cost_net` reflects what the source branch actually paid (net of VAT) for the stock being moved, which is what the destination should inherit as its cost basis.

`avg_unit_cost_net` is always populated by `getItems` / `getItem` — the SQL formula `(added_cost_net - removed_cost_net) / NULLIF(added_qty - removed_qty, 0)` is wrapped in `COALESCE(..., items.unit_cost / (IFNULL(taxes.rate_percentage, 0) / 100.0 + 1))`. This means even items with no inventory history (initial_stock_qty = 0, no purchases) or items where added_qty == removed_qty return a VAT-stripped fallback derived from the static `unit_cost` and the linked tax rate, instead of NULL. The same COALESCE pattern applies to `avg_unit_cost` (fallback = `items.unit_cost`) and `avg_unit_cost_tax` (fallback = `unit_cost - net`) for consistency.

The snapshot is captured once at entry creation in `createBatchTransferEntry` and then flows into the destination's `inventory_logs.adjustment_unit_cost` (`confirmTransferReceived`), the source's `inventory_logs.adjustment_unit_cost` (`materializeReceivedTransferLogs`), and any auto-created destination item's `unit_cost` (`autoCreateLocalItemForTransfer`). All three downstream sites already read from `entry.unit_cost_snapshot`, so the rule only needs to be enforced at the capture site.

### Navigation Structure

Five navigation stacks in `/src/stacks/`:

- `RootStack` — main app (items, recipes, purchases, revenues, expenses, reports, account)
- `AuthStack` — local authentication
- `CloudAuthStackV2` — cloud auth and onboarding
- `AccountSetupStack` — new account creation
- `ReinstallDetectedStack` — data recovery flow

Navigation outside components uses `RootNavigation.js` ref.

### State Management

Context API with 13+ providers in `/src/context/providers/`. Key providers:

- `CloudAuthContextProvider` — cloud auth state **and** company DB lifecycle (activates company DB, seeds defaults, clears React Query cache on sign-out). `AuthContextProvider` is deprecated.
- `AppConfigContextProvider` — global app config
- `ItemFormContextProvider`, `RecipeFormContextProvider`, `ExpenseFormContextProvider`, `SellingMenuFormContextProvider` — form state
- `SearchbarContextProvider`, `SalesCounterContextProvider` — feature-specific state

Access via corresponding `use*Context` hooks in `/src/hooks/`.

### Data Fetching

- **React Query v4** (`@tanstack/react-query`) for all cloud API calls. Config: 5-min `staleTime`, 10-min `cacheTime`, `refetchOnWindowFocus` and `refetchOnReconnect` disabled.
- **Axios** instance in `/src/api/cloudApiV2.js` with 30s timeout and Bearer token injection.
- Server query functions in `/src/serverDbQueries/v2/`.
- After mutations, invalidate relevant queries via `queryClient.invalidateQueries(['key'])`.

### Form Pattern

Formik + Yup throughout. Form state often stored in Context Providers for cross-component access. Most forms are in `/src/modals/`.

### Modal vs Screen Conventions

- **Do NOT add new screens to `/src/modals/`**. That directory contains legacy full-screen modals that will be migrated to `/src/screens/` in the future.
- New reusable modals/dialogs go in `/src/components/modals/`.
- New full-screen views go in `/src/screens/`.
